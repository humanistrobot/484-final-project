# 484-final-project
(mostly) python code for raincheck the virtual assistant.
We wanted to get rid of the problem of getting dressed appropriately for the weather. To solve this, we wanted to create a virtual assistant, both working with voice commands and text to advise the user on what to wear that day, based on the information we pulled from weather forecasting websites.


The final codes are in two files: raincheck_chatbot_final and raincheck_voiceassistant_final.
